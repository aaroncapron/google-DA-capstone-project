# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis
## **Overview**

This repository contains the advanced capstone project for the Google Data Analytics program, focusing on Cyclistic, a bike-sharing company based in Chicago. The project's primary objective is to analyze and identify key trends in bike usage to develop strategies for converting casual riders into annual members.

## **Project Goals**

- Clean and prepare Cyclistic's bike-sharing data for analysis.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand user patterns.
- Develop visualizations to communicate findings.
- Provide actionable insights and business recommendations.

## **Data Source**

The dataset used in this analysis is provided by Cyclistic and includes detailed records of bike trips taken by customers. 
The data I drew came from the August 2020 - July 2021 range, offering comprehensive insights into user behavior.

### **Tech Stack**
R, Tableau, Excel

### **Data Cleaning:**
- Importing and merging datasets.
- Handling missing values.
- Ensuring data consistency.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Analyzing ride duration, distance, and user demographics.
- Identifying peak usage times and popular routes.

### **Visualization:**
- Creating interactive dashboards using Tableau.
- Generating plots and graphs to illustrate key findings.
- Insights & Recommendations:
- Analyzing differences between casual riders and annual members.
- Suggesting marketing strategies to increase annual memberships.

## **Marketing Suggestions:**
I do not have a background in marketing at all, so please correct me if needed.
These are my suggestions for the marketing team to convert casual riders to annual members:

- Emphasize membership benefits with a focus on discounts during busy times of the year, Summer, and more on weekends. 
- Personalize customer discounts by asking the customer what their riding habits and preferences are.
- Have existing members give testimonials and their personal story on how using Cyclistic's system has changed their lives.
  This creates a community out of customers, offers discounts to existing customers, and encourages new customers to join the program. 

## **What I Learned**
Arguably the most important piece of this project, where I've spent a combined total of 40+ hours.
- Pivot Tables in Microsoft Excel
- Practice using R for data analysis and cleaning specifically using the 'tidyverse' package for data analysis 
- Graphs in Tableau, edited visual elements along with creating different charts and filters. 
- Design elements of an effective dashboard
