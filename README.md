# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis
## **Overview**

This repository contains the advanced capstone project for the Google Data Analytics program, focusing on Cyclistic, a bike-sharing company based in Chicago. The project's primary objective is to analyze and identify key trends in bike usage to develop strategies for converting casual riders into annual members.

## **Project Goals**

- Clean and prepare Cyclistic's bike-sharing data for analysis.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand user patterns.
- Develop visualizations to communicate findings.
- Provide actionable insights and business recommendations.

## **Data Source**

The dataset used in this analysis is provided by Cyclistic and includes detailed records of bike trips taken by customers. 
The data I drew came from the August 2020 - July 2021 range, offering comprehensive insights into user behavior.

### **Tech Stack**
R, Tableau, Excel

### **Data Cleaning:**
- Importing and merging datasets.
- Handling missing values.
